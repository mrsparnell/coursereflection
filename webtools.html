      <p class="MsoNormal">WordPress is an open-source website and blog creation tool.
It is one of the most popular blog sites today. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>


      <p class="MsoNormal">I found WordPress to be very user friendly. This was only my
second blog in WordPress, but I like it a lot. The themes were nice and fairly
easy to use and customize, which is always a plus. I like that WordPress makes
it very easy to manage multiple blogs using the same login credentials. This
was my second WordPress blog, but one of two that I created this semester. So,
before this semester was over, I had three blogs to maintain. I expected to
have to create a new blog with a new email address and password to keep up
with, but that wasn&#8217;t the case. However, since they redesigned the blog
management area, it is a little harder to find things you&#8217;re looking for, like
your list of blog sites so you can switch between them. The only blog site that
I like more is Weebly, which I was also introduced to this semester in a
different class. It is even more user friendly than WordPress and I think I&#8217;ve
gotten spoiled to that. <o:p></o:p></p>


      <p class="MsoNormal">Overall, I think blogs are a great tool to use in the
classroom because it lets students reflect on what they&#8217;ve previously learned
to not only see how far they&#8217;ve come, but also to refresh their memories on
things later in the semester. <o:p></o:p></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">SpicyNodes is a concept map tool and was one of my favorite
web-tools to use this semester. I have never been one who likes to draw out
maps or write outlines, but this tool definitely helps get the job done without
seeming like such a daunting task. As much as I hate to admit it, it really is
very useful for laying out websites, like we did here, or preparing to write
papers. I&#8217;m sure it could be used for many other tasks like giving instructions
on how to do something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can see myself
designing a SpicyNode for new employees to use as a reference when they aren&#8217;t
sure exactly how to do things. The great thing is that you can embed images and
videos (flash only) into these nodes to make it that much more informational.
It can be a little hard to follow at first, and filling in the information
could stand to be a little more user-friendly, but overall, this is an awesome
tool for students of many ages and employer / employees as well. It&#8217;s very easy
to share also, which helps. It would be extremely easy for me, if I designed a
class website for one of the classes I teach in the future, to embed my
SpicyNode on the page for students to refer to throughout the semester. <o:p></o:p></p>

FotoFlexer is an online imaging software site that provides the ability
for users to edit their photos in ways similar to those available in Photoshop,
but in a significantly condensed, more user-friendly package. Overall, I think
FotoFlexer is a great tool for people who need to be able to edit images but
don&#8217;t have access or ability to software like Photoshop. However, one important
thing that it lacks is the ability to adjust size and resolution of pictures.
That said, even with its capabilities it isn&#8217;t my favorite online image editor.
I used Pixlr last semester in my multimedia design class and I think it offered
a lot more tools and was more user friendly. It was setup very much like
Photoshop only stripped down. Honestly, the fact that it is so much like
Photoshop is probably the main reason I liked it so much because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m
most familiar with. <o:p></o:p></p>


      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;">The Google web album was okay, but nothing very special. It was, in my
opinion, equivalent to a Facebook photo album only a little more complicated to
use. <o:p></o:p></p>


      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;">I can&#8217;t see myself ever using these tools much because I think there
are some better, but similar, options available for free.<o:p></o:p></p>
